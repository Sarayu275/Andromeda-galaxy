            <h1>The Andromeda Galaxy</h1>
            <p>The Andromeda Galaxy, also known as Messier 31, M31, or NGC 224, is the nearest spiral galaxy to the Milky Way and the largest galaxy in the Local Group. It is located approximately 2.537 million light-years from Earth.</p>
            <p>Andromeda is expected to collide with the Milky Way in about 4.5 billion years, merging to form a new galaxy known as "Milkomeda" or "Milkdromeda". This galaxy is home to approximately one trillion stars, more than twice the number in the Milky Way.</p>
            <p>With a diameter of about 220,000 light-years, Andromeda is the largest galaxy in the Local Group, which also includes the Milky Way, the Triangulum Galaxy, and about 54 other smaller galaxies. It is visible to the naked eye from Earth on clear, dark nights, appearing as a fuzzy patch in the constellation of Andromeda.</p>
